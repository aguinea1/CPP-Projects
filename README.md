# ðŸ’¡ C++ Projects

Welcome to my curated collection of C++ programming projects.  
These works explore object-oriented programming, clean class design, encapsulation, and resource management in modern C++.

All of these were built using pure C++, with a strong emphasis on readability, structure, and a deep understanding of how the language works under the hood.

### ðŸ§© Projects

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 00](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP00)  
The first module in C++.  
It introduces essential concepts such as classes, private attributes, public methods, object instantiation, and basic stream handling.  
Perfect for understanding the shift from C to C++ through a more structured and object-oriented approach.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 01](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP01)  
Focuses on pointers, dynamic memory, and arrays.  
Strengthens understanding of memory management, deep vs shallow copy, and safe handling of resources.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 02](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP02)  
Introduces inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions, and abstract classes.  
Essential for mastering advanced OOP concepts in C++.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 03](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP03)  
Covers templates, exception handling, and operator overloading.  
Key for writing reusable and robust C++ code.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 04](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP04)  
Focus on STL containers, iterators, and algorithms.  
Helps write clean, efficient, and expressive code using the C++ Standard Library.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 05](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP05)  
Introduces **exception handling** and reinforces object-oriented practices.  
Covers nested classes, proper error management, and robust program design.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 06](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP06)  
Dedicated to **type casting** in C++.  
Explores implicit vs explicit casts, static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, and const_cast, clarifying when and why to use each.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 07](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP07)  
Focuses on **C++ templates**.  
Shows how to write generic and reusable code with class and function templates, building flexible abstractions.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 08](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP08)  
Explores advanced use of **STL containers** such as vector, stack, and map.  
Trains in implementing efficient algorithms and leveraging container-specific operations.
