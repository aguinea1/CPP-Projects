# ðŸ’¡ C++ Projects

Welcome to my curated collection of C++ programming projects.  
These works explore object-oriented programming, clean class design, encapsulation, and resource management in modern C++.

All of these were built using pure C++, with a strong emphasis on readability, structure, and a deep understanding of how the language works under the hood.

## ðŸ§© Projects

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 00](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP00)  
The first module in C++.  
It introduces essential concepts such as classes, private attributes, public methods, object instantiation, and basic stream handling.  
Perfect for understanding the shift from C to C++ through a more structured and object-oriented approach.

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 01](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP01)  
Focuses on pointers, dynamic memory, and arrays.  
Strengthens understanding of memory management, deep vs shallow copy, and safe handling of resources.

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 02](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP02)  
Introduces inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions, and abstract classes.  
Essential for mastering advanced OOP concepts in C++.

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 03](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP03)  
Covers templates, exception handling, and operator overloading.  
Key for writing reusable and robust C++ code.

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 04](https://github.com/aguinea1/CPP04)  
Focus on STL containers, iterators, and algorithms.  
Helps write clean, efficient, and expressive code using the C++ Standard Library.
