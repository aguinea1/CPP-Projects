# ðŸ’¡ C++ Projects

Welcome to my curated collection of C++ programming projects.  
These works explore object-oriented programming, clean class design, encapsulation, and resource management in modern C++.

All of these were built using pure C++, with a strong emphasis on readability, structure, and a deep understanding of how the language works under the hood.

## ðŸ§© Projects

### ðŸ”¹ [CPP Module 00](https://github.com/tu_usuario/cpp00)  
The first module in  C++.  
It introduces essential concepts such as classes, private attributes, public methods, object instantiation, and basic stream handling.  
Perfect for understanding the shift from C to C++ through a more structured and object-oriented approach.
